# elk-flowdata
<br>
ELK configs for *Flow data, I will make a document when I find time to say how to port it to another flow provider its really simple!
<br>
Open for suggestions this was one of my first attempts at ELK though!
<br>
Coming Soon:
<br>
AWS VPC FLOW LOGS (Ready just need to tidy up a bit and try use s3 from inside of logstash)
<br>
Sflow (Not hard one to do)
